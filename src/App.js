        <h3>Holberton</h3>
        <p>I learned that I can code and that I enjoy coding. I learned that difficult things can be conquered with hard work and diligence. I have learned that it is important to be prepared for good opportunities to come, by making sure to work hard. I have learned that burning out is more psychological than physical and that it is important to take time to really relax. I have also learned that I need to learn how to really relax. I have learned stepping away from a problem can lead to it being solved, but sometimes it's important to bust your head through problems to find solutions. Practice leads to simple clean solutions.</p>

        <h3>Personal Story</h3>
        <p>
        I am Christian Williams, I have moved around pretty much all my life so I never really had the chance to make childhood friends or anything like that, but this was a benefit because I had the chance to meet and interact with many different types of people from different backgrounds and struggles. It has humbled me to interact to have the privilege of interacting with so many in the sense that this experience has made me realize that I don’t know too much about people and that there is no such thing as a type of person that doesn’t exist. In other words, any type of person can exist, any type that you can imagine can and probably does exist or will exist in the future or did exist in the past. This single fact alone has opened my eyes to the fact that people are very interesting and that it is important to treat people like they have something that they can teach you.


Before Holberton when I was going to college, I founded the music club because I wanted to give students the chance to learn musical instruments, communicate with music, and jam. Throughout my life music has been something I have been very consistent with as a hobby. I love playing, listening to, and creating music. It was something that has given me a ton of peace throughout my life. That said, college can be very stressful and toxic for students growing up and figuring things out so it's important to have avenue to let off the toxic stress you could be storing.

Our club grew very fast and it eventually won an award before I decided to leave the school for Holberton. Because of the start, I had with that club I quickly learned that more needed to be done, so I became more involved: I assisted other student leaders that wanted to found their own clubs, and helped them with the logistics behind getting a club started, setting up meetings, and the financial component of clubs, I also went on to take up officer roles in various clubs and I went on to become the treasurer of student government.

A lot of students joined our club and we hosted some concerts and impromptu jam sessions in our school hallway, this ended up benefiting a ton of students that didn't really have anywhere to go and that were depressed. It ended up being the hub for a majority of the fun and meaningful moments with music. It is a beautiful thing to know that I had a direct part in all that happened.

        <h3>Self Synopsis</h3>
        <p>
        I am a software engineer. I have been working with js, react, python, and C recently. I am super comfortable with most of the languages I know. I have been recently working with python to program lcd’s.

I am a person that is focused on making sure I make the most out of where I land, when Holberton came to new haven it was a no-brainer for me to stop wasting my time at the college i was going to so i left and joined the school to learn and code as well. I have recently won the summer PlayStation hackathon, i owe it to this school for providing me with the curriculum so that I could learn how to code properly enough to be very useful.

I plan to be a social software engineer, I will impact my teammates by offering them encouragement and diligent effort. I am motivated by the realization that there is so much more to learn and I have so much more to grow. I am motivated by being able to push myself forward and helping others to realize that they should continue pushing forward as well.
